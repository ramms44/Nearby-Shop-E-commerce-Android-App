Concept
Nearby Shops is a Hyperlocal Shopping platform where a customer can buy directly from the shops available in his/her local area and get their orders delivered to their home or just pick the order up from the shop.

In the new emerging world, customers are getting tired of going outside the home to shop every day. They would much prefer to simply place an order and have the products delivered to their home the same day.

Conventional e-commerce has issues ... the delivery takes a long time and it's more difficult to trust unknown vendors whom you cannot see and meet. Hyperlocal e-commerce solves these issues because delivery is faster and customers can reach out to the vendors easily.

Nearby Shops can also be used as a food Delivery platform where restaurants can use it to deliver food.

Nearby Shops implements Alibaba's New Offline-to-Online Concept, where customers discover products online and then pick those products up from physical stores.

Online to Offline

You should now open the project with the latest version of Android Studio. The project will not compile unless you add the following property in the local.properties file.

This project uses mapbox android sdk which requires mapbox style url. To add the style url in the project open this project in the android studio and add the Mapbox Style URL in the local.properties file.

It is okay if you don't have an actual Mapbox style url. In that case, just put some dummy text in place of the url.

mapbox_style_url="your-mapbox-style-url"
